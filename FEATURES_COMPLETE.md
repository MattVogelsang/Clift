## 🔧 What Needs Implementation

### To Make Automation Fully Functional:

1. **Job Board Integration** (Choose one approach):
   - **Option A**: Use job APIs (RapidAPI, Adzuna)
   - **Option B**: Web scraping (Puppeteer)
   - **Option C**: Hybrid approach

2. **Dependencies to Install**:
   ```bash
   npm install puppeteer          # For automation
   npm install indeed-scraper     # For Indeed
   npm install openai            # For AI features
   ```

3. **Configuration Needed**:
   - Add job board API keys
   - Set up LinkedIn automation credentials
   - Configure cron secret
   - Test application flow

4. **Email Notifications**:
   - Integrate SendGrid/Resend
   - Daily job match emails
   - Application status updates

**Week 2**: Auto-apply
- Set up Puppeteer for one platform
- Test application submission
- Add error handling

**Week 3**: Automation
